# Prediction-of-sincere-questions
Classify questions as sincere or insincere. Deployed the model using flask on colab. . It helps to eliminate questions that contain abusive language, hate speeches, sexual contents or contents that can lead to violence. Used NLP library for text pre-processing, pre-trained BURT model from TensorFlow hub and ran different parts of model on different devices (CPU or GPU). 


We used a pre-trained bert model. We trained it on Quora questions dataset. Here are some demos of working of flask application.
